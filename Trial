<h4>Here, we will talk about the experiments we did before selecting the best option of the model </h4>

<h3>Trial 1</h3>

<h4>We worked on <strong>MobileNet v1</strong> which has been trained on the COCO dataset  and use DeepSORT to Track the  Objects.

MobileNet based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build lightweight deep neural networks that can have low latency for mobile and embedded devices.

    The network consists of 28 convolutional layers and 1 fully connected layer followed by a softmax layer.  Batch normalization and ReLU is applied after convolution

It uses TensorFlow Lite as framework 

We ran MobileNet v1 in a <strong>CPU </strong>environment, and it was capable of processing <strong>1.5 frames per second</strong>

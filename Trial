Here we illustrate the alternatives between the model when using different versions of YOLO object detection and framework

TRIAL 1 : 

We worked on MobileNet v1 which has been trained on the COCO dataset  and use DeepSORT to Track the  Objects.

MobileNet based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build lightweight 
deep neural networks that can have low latency for mobile and embedded devices.

The network consists of 28 convolutional layers and 1 fully connected layer followed by a softmax layer. 
Batch normalization and ReLU is applied after convolution

** It uses TensorFlow Lite as framework **

** We ran MobileNet v1 in a CPU environment, and it was capable of processing 1.5 frames per second. **

Because the number of frame per second is very small, we will use another architecture 
---------------------------------------------

TRIAL 2 : 

We work on YOLOv3 which was Implemented in Tensorflow2.It uses Darknet 53 architecture, 
which was a significantly improved version and had 53 convolution layers.

** It uses TensorFlow as framework **

** We ran YOLOv3 in a CPU(i7 10750H) environment, and it was capable of processing 3.5 frames per second. **

Still the number of frames per second small, we need MORE frames !!!

We have three options for increasing the # of frames :
1- Reduce resolution
2- Use "tiny-yolo" object detection
3- Use GPU
